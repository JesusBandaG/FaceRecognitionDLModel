# Face Recognition DL Model
In this repository you will find a Deep Learning face recognition model trained with thermal pictures of 18 people. In some of these pictures people are wearing a cap, glasses or even both. 
The database used is the "Terravic Facial IR Database" which is the dataset #4 available on the OTCBVS Benchmark Dataset Collection (https://vcipl-okstate.org/pbvs/bench/).

To work with this Jupyter Notebook as it is, you should download the database mentioned above and save it inside your Google Drive in a new folder named **"Terravic_Facial_IR_Database"**.
